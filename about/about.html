        <p>Hello! My name is Yuqin Deng, and I am a sophomore at UW-Madison, majoring in Journalism & Mass Communication and Information Science, with certificates in Gender & Women's Studies and Education Policy.

        Originally from China, I embarked on my journey as an international student, facing initial challenges of adaptation and cultural transition. Over time, I found a sense of belonging through student-led communities like CSSA (Chinese Students and Scholars Association) and MSC (Multicultural Student Center), where I witnessed the power of student networks in fostering support and connection.

        Beyond academics, I have a deep passion for public relations, digital storytelling, and community engagement. I enjoy exploring media trends, social platforms, and how technology shapes modern communication. In my free time, I love discovering new restaurants, sharing lifestyle content on Xiaohongshu (Little Red Book), and analyzing cultural narratives through literature and media.</p>
